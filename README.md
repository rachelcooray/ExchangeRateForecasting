# Financial Forecasting

This project involves using neural networks to forecast financial exchange rates. Specifically, we use a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model to predict USD/EUR exchange rates based on historical data.

## Project Structure

- `ExchangeUSD (2).xlsx`: The dataset containing historical exchange rates.
- `financial_forecasting.R`: The R script implementing the forecasting model.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Requirements

- R
- R packages: `readxl`, `neuralnet`, `caret`, `Metrics`, `dplyr`
